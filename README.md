# EcoInvest

EcoInvest is the first app developed by SuplaCrew in the Apple Academy labs at the Federal Institute of Ceará (IFCE). This partnership gave us the opportunity to learn the basics of the Swift language, which is widely used on IOS devices. The main objective of the "EcoInvest" app is to encourage sustainability on the planet, facilitate the dissemination of information about caring for nature, and generate rewards through sustainable activities via the app.
